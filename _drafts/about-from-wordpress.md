Hi, I am David and by now you'd have guessed I am a Developer.

Yes, that's right, and there are so many great perks about being a developer; asides the wishful thoughts of one day becoming <del>the next genius billionaire playboy philanthropist</del>Â very wealthy.

To be honest, the best part is that you totally get to call the shots over everything that happens in the context of your small created universe. It's a 'god' feeling, you feel like a creator.

By the way, although I have played with virtually all the 'authority' platforms out there, I am more inclined to developing on the .NET platform, yes, that's right, knowing fully well about the controversies surrounding .Net software development.
