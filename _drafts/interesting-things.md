[MSIL Weaving  with Mono.Cecil ??](http://justinangel.net/automagicallyimplementinginotifypropertychanged) : There are 2 interesting things about this post, first is I can automatically implement INotify property changed with IL manipulation, and second is that I can hook an MSBuild step to a library that I have defined.

I need to link to this from WorkSuite blog
