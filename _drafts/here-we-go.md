I've just re-launched http://davidolubajo.com, and I am very excited !

Launching a personal website to share my thoughts, ideas and ramblings with the world has always been a burning desire since I started using the internet.

For me, getting to this point has been a real struggle due to my 'near-perfectionist' nature. I explored so many options like using hosted Blog Engines, extending open source ones, and even coding my own sh*t from the scratch. I just couldn't make up my mind, and so I delayed for 2 years.

Anyways, I'm glad I'm done with all that now, and finally settled with Orchard CMS, for a whole lot of reasons, which I shall share in a later post.

Who am I ? : Well, I am a coder (Software Engineer ;P) by day, and at night.... let's just say I am batman.

I love Javascript and very soon I will start writing it server-side (Node JS FTW !), but for now I will stick with my C#/ ASP.NET MVC/Web API stack.

I think I have said too much, let's start this thing already, right ?

Anyways people, let the fun and games begin  :D!!
