Whenever i'm faced with a problem, I usually go through a cycle of phases emotionally.
I start with feeling down and worried, then I progress to being withdrawn, next, I actively ignore the problem, before I then go on to putting it in a box.

The box is how I try to encapsulate all of the problem context. It makes referring to the problem a lot easier and less mentally stressful.

But usually, the last thing I do is conclude that there is a solution; somewhere, somehow...you just gotta find itâ€¦

(How I solve problems by first establishing mentally that the problem can be solved, and there is no magic.

This is the same way I got into software development BTW. Whenever I looked at codes back then, I would squinge my eyes as if in pain.)
