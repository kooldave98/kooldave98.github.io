Long before I started writing any meaningful and useful code, I would look at online tutorials, open source code bases, sample code, and even very complex code projects.

One thing I established at the time was there is a lot of code out there, (I couldn't tell the difference between good and bad code - which I can sort of do now.)

I used to ask myself how could anyone possibly write all of this, not even with a team of the best developers in the world.

But at the back of my mind, I knew there just had to be a way. I would think of all the many successful production projects out there, and tell myself: if they could do this
 then there must be a way.
