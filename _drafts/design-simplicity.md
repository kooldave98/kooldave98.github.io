Long before I started writing any meaningful and useful code, I would look at online tutorials, open source code bases, sample code, and even very complex seemingly unintelligible code projects.

I very quickly established that there is a lot of complex code out there, I really couldn't tell apart good code from bad - I like to think I can now.

I would ask myself again and again: "how could anyone possibly write all of this?", not even with a team of the best developers in the world.

But I was resolute, I knew there just had to be a way, a trick. I would think of all the many successful production projects out there, and tell myself: if they could do this then there must be a way.

The secret, it turns out, is that all complex things are built up from countless stupidly simple things.

[maybe also a simple vs easy maxim]
