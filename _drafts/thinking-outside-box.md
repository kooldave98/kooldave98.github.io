The first step to solving any problem is to understand it

But, our understanding is usually fuzzy and mentally biased

## Why is our understanding biased

Humans interpret observations differently
Your perception is really just one way of interpreting a concept.
It is influenced by your assumptions/perspective.
What you naturally perceive may not necessarily be everything there is to a matter.
